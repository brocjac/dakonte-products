    <p>Back when the TIE Office-Mates brand began, most of our customers were industrial companies needing rugged heavy-duty reusable job ticket holders to withstand everyday abuse in their shops and warehouses.</p>
    <p>Now over 35 years later, TIE Office-Mates customers span a wide universe of industries including aerospace, print shops, education, healthcare, marketing, management consulting, retail, transportation, construction, hospitality, airlines and many more.</p>
    <p>Not only are TIE products heavy-duty and durable, the sewing and materials used are close to fashion accessory quality. So they not only perform well, they look great anywhere from the shop, to everyday office use to the boardroom.</p>
    <p>Additional product lines were added over the years including <span>Great Menu Covers, EASY Partitions</span> and <span>COVID Business Response Products</span> to serve our customer needs.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Dakonte Product Group, Inc (DPG) was established to manage this growing corporate family of divisions with the same mission of delivering great products and great service to customers.</p>
