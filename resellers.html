            <h3>Reseller Benefits</h3>
            <p>Marketplace Differentiation Offering Custom Products.</p>
            <p>Custom products are a great way for you to differentiate your offerings to customers.</p>
            <p>Generating repeat orders is also easier since your custom products are difficult or impossible for your customers to buy anywhere else. </p>
            <p>DPG’s vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities supports you and your customer to rapidly design, prototype and test tailored made product solutions that meet your customer’s exact requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">
            <h3>Private Labeling</h3>
            <p>All of DPG products are unmarked until time of shipment. </p>
            <p>This allows you to specify any branded labeling, packaging or promotional marketing materials for your orders without the risk of losing future customer orders made with direct purchases from DPG.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">
            <h3>Drop-ship Program</h3>
            <p>You can blind drop-ship to your customers anywhere in the United States and Canada.</p>
            <p>Other countries may be possible with advanced notice and additional processing fees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">
            <h3>Shipping Carrier Selection</h3>
            <p>You can specify UPS, FedEx, USPS or an LTL carrier with shipping charges prepaid and added to your invoice, collect or third party.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">
            <h3>Wholesale Pricing</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">

        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">

        </div>
        <div class="hover-affect-1 reseller">
            <h3>No Minimum Annual Order Value</h3>
            <p>Your reseller discount pricing will be determined up front by working with you to estimate your annual sales volume. </p>
            <p>As your annual volume increases, addition discounts can be added to increase your market competitiveness.</p>
